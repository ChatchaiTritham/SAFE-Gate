Highlights

• Conservative merging prevents ensemble averaging's safety signal dilution
• Six parallel gates ensure 100% critical case detection with zero false negatives
• Formal safety properties proven mathematically and validated computationally
• Explainable audit trails document which gate enforced final risk tier and why
• Real-time performance (<2ms) enables emergency department deployment
